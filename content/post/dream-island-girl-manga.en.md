[Dream Island Girl](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/671044) is a japanese movie stared on 1975, and one of my favorites. But we don't talk about it.

On 2001 a guy callled [Yoshihiro Aita(相田佳洋)](https://www.youtube.com/@yotchin1), written a [mangá](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga) based on the movie, and published it on his blog. He made some fame, even if [Sachiyo Nakao](https://www2.nhk.or.jp/archives/articles/?id=D0009070171_00000),the main actress, cite him on his [page](http://www.utopiano.com/old/f/sachiyo/). Unfortunately, the service that host your [blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20010629120037/http://www1.odn.ne.jp/aac67070/) shuts down, and the manga had been lost, becames [Lost Media](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_media).

When I was searching the manga and your old blog, I found your e-mail. I send him a message. He replied me, and said that will search for the manuscript, and will send to me.

When he found it, he translate to English and send to me.. And he allows me to publish the manga. Then I made a Portuguese version, if someone want to read, download bellow. I will link the Aita's Social media, if someone want to see his job.
